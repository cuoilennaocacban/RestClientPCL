# RestClientPCL
A Portable Class Library for rest consuming

Most of the project I'm working on are using their own implementation to request data from API, then convert the return to Object
If you find this is your case, then you can use this library to do that automatically for you

The only thing this lib will do is send request, receive respond. End of story.

If you want more funtions (OAuth, Download File, etc), feel free to create extension to this lib, or fork it to modify for your own need.

ALL KIND OF CONTRIBUTIONS ARE WELCOME
